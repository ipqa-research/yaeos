There are multiple open source equations of state libraries, like:

- [Clapeyron](https://github.com/ClapeyronThermo/Clapeyron.jl) `julia`
- [FeOs](https://github.com/feos-org/feos) `rust` with `Python` bindings
- [teqp](https://github.com/usnistgov/teqp) `C++` with `Python` bindings
- [thermo](https://github.com/CalebBell/thermo) `python`
- [thermopack](https://github.com/thermotools/thermopack) `Fortran` with `Python` bindings
- [CoolProp](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp) `C++` with `Python` bindings

Here we are presenting yet another (still in development) one, that tackles the
same problem just, in another way. Mostly exploiting the readability and
extensibility of Modern Fortran for scientists to have an easy way to implement
new thermodynamic models without dealing with lower-level languages but still
getting decent performance.
And also this framework provides the possibility of using analytically obtained
derivatives so both options are easily available.

We focus mainly on that the addition of a new thermodynamic model as easily as
possible. Also providing our models too!

For now, we only include residual Helmholtz model (like Cubic or Saft Equations
of State). But we'll be adding other models like $G^E$ (UNIFAC for example).

# A little taste of `yaeos`
A lot of users get the bad picture of Fortran being old and archaic since most
of the codes they've seen are written in ancient `F77`.

```fortran
use yaeos, only: PengRobinson76, pressure, ArModel

integer, parameter :: n=2   ! Number of components
real(8) :: V, T, P, dPdN(n) ! variables to calculate
class(ArModel), allocatable :: model ! Model

real(pr) :: z(n), tc(n), pc(n), w(n), kij(n, n), lij(n, n)

z = [0.3, 0.7]
tc = [190., 310.]
pc = [14., 30.]
w = [0.001, 0.03]
kij = reshape([0., 0.1, 0.1, 0.], [n,n])
lij = kij / 2 

model =  PengRobinson76(tc, pc, w, kij, lij)

V = 1
T = 150

call pressure(model, z, V, T, P)
print *, P

! Obtain derivatives adding them as optional arguments! 
call pressure(model, z, V, T, P, dPdN=dPdN)
print *, dPdN
```

# How to install/run it
`yaeos` is intended to use as a [`fpm`](fpm.fortran-lang.org)

You can either:

- Generate a new project that uses `yaeos` as a dependency

```bash
fpm new my_project
```

In the `fpm.toml` file add:

```toml
[dependencies]
yaeos = {git="https://github.com/ipqa-research/yaeos"}
```

- Clone this repository and just modify the executables in the `app` directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ipqa-research/yaeos
cd yaeos
fpm run
```

# Including new models with Automatic Differentiation.
We are using the `hyperdual` module developed by [Philipp Rehner](https://github.com/prehner) and [Gernot Bauer](https://github.com/g-bauer)

> The automatic differentiation API isn't fully optimized yet so performance is
> much slower than it should be.

```fortran
type, extends(ArModelAdiff) :: YourNewModel
   type(Substances) :: composition
   real(8), allocatable :: parameters(:) ! A vector of parameters
contains
   procedure :: Ar => arfun
   procedure :: get_v0 => v0
end type
```

```fortran
subroutine arfun(self, n, v, t, Ar)
   class(YourNewModel), intent(in) :: self
   type(hyperdual), intent(in) :: n(:) ! Number of moles
   type(hyperdual), intent(in) :: v ! Volume [L]
   type(hyperdual), intent(in) :: t ! Temperature [K]
   type(hyperdual), intent(out) :: ar_value ! Residual Helmholtz Energy

   ! A very complicated residual helmholtz function of a mixture
   Ar = sum(n) * v * t / self%parameters(1)
end subroutine

function v0(self, n, p, t)
   class(YourNewModel), intent(in) :: self
   real(pr), intent(in) :: n(:) ! Number of moles
   real(pr), intent(in) :: p ! Pressure [bar]
   real(pr), intent(in) :: t ! Temperature [K]
   real(pr) :: v0

   v0 = self%parameters(3)
end function
```

A complete implementation of the PR76 Equation of State can me found in
`example/adiff/adiff_pr76.f90`.

All the thermodynamic properties can be found in `yaeos_thermoprops` and called
like:

```fortran
use yaeos_thermoprops, only: fugacity_vt
use my_new_model, only: YourNewModel
...
type(YourNewModel) :: eos
eos%parameters = [1, 2, 3]
call fugacity_vt(eos, n, v, t, lnfug=lnfug, dlnphidn=dlnphidn)
```

# Documentation
The latest API documentation for the `main` branch can be found
[here](https://ipqa-research.github.io/yaeos). This was generated from the source
code using [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford). We're
working in extending it more.
