</p>

The `yaeos` Python API is on and early stage of development. So the API will 
change with time. The supported operative system is Linux, and the supported 
Python versions are 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13.

## Important advice
Since `yaeos` is written in Fortran, Python users can have some little issues
understanding and finding things in the documentation. Please, **we recommend
looking at the "Getting Started - Using This Documentation" section of the
[Tutorial](https://ipqa-research.github.io/yaeos/page/python-api/tutorial/tutorial_tree.html)
 down below**, there you will understand how to use this documentation.
