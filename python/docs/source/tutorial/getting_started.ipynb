    "## Using This Documentation\n",
    "`yaeos` is a Fortran library of thermodynamic equations of state (EOS). If you\n",
    "are reading this, probably you want to use `yaeos` in your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `yaeos` the mathematical models are implemented in Fortran. The Python\n",
    "functions just call the Fortran routines via a `C` interface (compiled with\n",
    "`numpy.f2py`) and return the results to Python. Even if you are not interested\n",
    "in the Fortran side and you only want to use the Python API, you should know\n",
    "the following:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> The documentation is divided in two parts, the Fortran side and the Python\n",
    ">> side. The Python side Tutorial and API documentation has all the information\n",
    ">> you need to use all the functions and classes in the Python API. But, **the\n",
    ">> Fortran side documentation also have more information of each EOS, like the\n",
    ">> mathematical expressions, derivatives, and bibliographic references** that\n",
    ">> may be useful for you to understand the models and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **You should follow the Python documentation until you want to know more\n",
    ">> about a model, the meaning of his parameters, or the mathematical\n",
    ">> expressions**. For that please refer to the Fortran user documentation:\n",

    "## Installation Instructions\n",
    "### Local Installation\n",
    "To install the last version of `yaeos` uploaded to PyPI simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install yaeos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building from source\n",
    "To build `yaeos` from source you can clone the repository and install it with \n",
    "pip. The system dependencies are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LAPACK\n",
    "- Fortran compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "To build and install do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ipqa-research/yaeos.git\n",
    "cd yaeos/python\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting a Google Colab to use yaeos\n",
    "To install `yaeos` on Google Colab you can do the following command to install \n",
    "the last version uploaded to PyPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "%pip install yaeos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you want to install the `dev` version of `yaeos` in a\n",
    "Google Colab and try out the new (and experimental) features you can execute\n",
    "the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Note: do not execute the next commands if you don't want the `dev` version.\n",
    ">> use the previous command instead and skip the next ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "# Installing the dev version into a google colab\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  import google.colab\n",
    "  IN_COLAB = True\n",
    "except:\n",
    "  IN_COLAB = False\n",
    "\n",
    "if IN_COLAB:\n",
    "  %pip install 'git+https://github.com/ipqa-research/yaeos.git@dev#subdirectory=python'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation For Developers\n",
    "If you want to contribute to `yaeos` you may want to install the Python API\n",
    "in development mode. This will allow you to edit the code and test it without\n",
    "having to reinstall it every time you make a change on the Python side. For\n",
    "that you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ipqa-research/yaeos.git\n",
    "cd yaeos/python\n",
    "pip install -r requirements-build.txt\n",
    "pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n",
    "pip install -e . --no-build-isolation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Yaeos units\n",
    "In thermodynamics, the units of evaluated properties are defined by the value\n",
    "of the ideal gas constant `R`. In `yaeos`, we use the value of `R` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R = 0.08314462618 \\frac{bar \\; L}{K \\; mol}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that, pressure must be specified as bar $[bar]$, volume as liters\n",
    "$[L]$, temperature as Kelvin $[K]$ and number of moles as moles $[mol]$. The\n",
    "returns of the properties will be in the same units as the inputs. Energetic\n",
    "properties as enthalpy, entropy, etc. will have unit of $[bar \\; L]$, which\n",
    "equals to centijoules $[cJ]$."
