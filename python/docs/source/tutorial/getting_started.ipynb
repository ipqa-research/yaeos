    "`yaeos` is a Fortran library of thermodynamic equations of state (EOS).\n",
    "If you're reading this, you're probably looking to use `yaeos` from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, all thermodynamic models are implemented in Fortran. The Python\n",
    "API provides simple functions that call these Fortran routines through a `C`\n",
    "interface (compiled using `numpy.f2py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're only interested in using `yaeos` from Python, that's totally fine —\n",
    "but keep in mind the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The documentation is divided into two parts: **Python-side** and\n",
    "> **Fortran-side**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Python tutorial and API reference contain everything you need to work\n",
    "> with the Python interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, **the Fortran documentation provides additional technical details\n",
    "> for each model**, such as mathematical expressions, derivatives, and\n",
    "> bibliographic references. These may be useful if you want to understand the\n",
    "> models more deeply.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Start with the Python documentation.** Refer to the Fortran documentation\n",
    "> only if you want to explore a model’s theory, equations, or parameters\n",
    "> meaning in more detail.\n",

    "## Installation Instructions\n",
    "### Local Installation\n",
    "To install the last version of `yaeos` uploaded to\n",
    "[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/yaeos/) simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install yaeos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building from source\n",
    "To build `yaeos` from source you can clone the repository and install it with \n",
    "pip. The system dependencies are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LAPACK\n",
    "- Fortran compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "To build and install do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ipqa-research/yaeos.git\n",
    "cd yaeos/python\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting a Google Colab to use yaeos\n",
    "To install `yaeos` on Google Colab you can do the following command to install \n",
    "the last version uploaded to PyPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "%pip install yaeos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you want to install the `dev` version of `yaeos` in a\n",
    "Google Colab and try out the new (and experimental) features you can execute\n",
    "the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Note: do not execute the next commands if you don't want the `dev` version.\n",
    ">> use the previous command instead and skip the next ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "# Installing the dev version into a google colab\n",
    "try:\n",
    "  import google.colab\n",
    "  IN_COLAB = True\n",
    "except:\n",
    "  IN_COLAB = False\n",
    "\n",
    "if IN_COLAB:\n",
    "  %pip install 'git+https://github.com/ipqa-research/yaeos.git@dev#subdirectory=python'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation For Developers\n",
    "If you want to contribute to `yaeos`, you may want to install the Python API in\n",
    "development mode. This lets you edit the code and test your changes without\n",
    "having to reinstall the package every time you modify the Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ipqa-research/yaeos.git\n",
    "cd yaeos/python\n",
    "pip install -r requirements-build.txt\n",
    "pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n",
    "pip install -e . --no-build-isolation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Yaeos units\n",
    "In thermodynamics, the units of evaluated properties are defined by the value\n",
    "of the ideal gas constant `R`. In `yaeos`, we use the value of `R` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R = 0.08314462618 \\frac{bar \\; L}{K \\; mol}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that, pressure must be specified as bar $[bar]$, volume as liters\n",
    "$[L]$, temperature as Kelvin $[K]$ and number of moles as moles $[mol]$. The\n",
    "returns of the properties will be in the same units as the inputs. Energetic\n",
    "properties as enthalpy, entropy, etc. will have unit of $[bar \\; L]$, which\n",
    "equals to centijoules $[cJ]$."
