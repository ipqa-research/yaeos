    "# Bulk Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "`yaeos` is a library based on Equation-of-State calculations. An Equation of\n",
    "State (EOS) is a mathematical model that describes the relationship between\n",
    "thermodynamic properties of a system, typically pressure (P), volume (V), and\n",
    "temperature (T). These equations are fundamental in physics, chemistry, and\n",
    "engineering, especially in thermodynamics and fluid mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "EOS models are used to predict phase behavior, thermodynamic properties, and\n",
    "equilibrium conditions of gases, liquids, solids, and mixtures. They are widely\n",
    "applied in areas such as chemical engineering, petroleum engineering, and\n",
    "material science. From the ideal gas law, to cubic equations of state and SAFT,\n",
    "to more complex models, EOS are essential tools for the study and design of\n",
    "processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic way of defining an EOS is though a mathematical equation that\n",
    "express the pressure as a function of the volume and temperature. For example,\n",
    "the Van der Waals EOS is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    P = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a}{v^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P$ is the pressure, $v$ is the molar volume, $T$ is the\n",
    "temperature, $R$ is the gas constant, and $a$ and $b$ are parameters that\n",
    "depend on the substance. For mixtures, the $a$ and $b$ parameters are\n",
    "calculated from the pure components parameters using a mixing rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modern way of defining an EOS is through a mathematical model that express\n",
    "the residual Helmholtz free energy as a function of the mole number, volume and\n",
    "temperature. This approach is more general and allows for a more flexible\n",
    "definition of the EOS in the context of implementing it in code. All\n",
    "thermodynamic properties can be calculated from the residual Helmholtz free\n",
    "energy and its derivatives. `yaeos` is based on this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    A^{r}(n, V, T) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{V} \\left(P(n,V,T) - \\frac{nRT}{V} \\right) dV\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want to know how each bulk property is calculated from the residual\n",
    "Helmholtz free energy, please refer to the [Fortran User Documentation](https://ipqa-research.github.io/yaeos/page/index.html)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example model\n",
    "First, we are going the import the `yaeos` library and instantiate a\n",
    "Peng-Robinson (1976) model with two components. Later in this tutorial you will\n",
    "learn got to instantiate different models, but for now we will use this one as\n",
    "an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The important thing to understand is that all the EoS can evaluate\n",
    "the thermodynamic properties explained in this section.**"
