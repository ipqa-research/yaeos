# yaeos examples
Here are located a set of examples of how the library could be used.

We show them in three different categories:

- basics: The basics of what can be done with the library
    1. Thermodynamic properties
    2. Saturation points
    3. Phase split (FlashPT and FlashVT)
    4. Phase envelopes tracing
    5. Implementation of a simple algorithm to calculate pure component
      saturation pressure.
- Advanced: How a more advanced user can take benefit of the library.
- extra: Other set of examples with no particular structure.
